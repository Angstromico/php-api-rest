# PHP REST API – Practice Project

This is a simple REST API built with `PHP` for learning and practice purposes.
The goal is to understand how to structure an `API`, handle `HTTP` methods, work with `JSON` data, and interact with a database (optional).

## 🚀 Features

- Lightweight `REST API` built with native `PHP` (no frameworks)

- Clean folder structure

- JSON request/response handling

- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

- Simple routing system

This project is free to use and modify.

If you want, I can also generate the full API skeleton, including folders, routing logic, controller examples, and CRUD code.
